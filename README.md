# hal1210

a system daemon for the sickest media pc ever

(in a vscode workspace since cargo doesn't like it when you nest different architectures)
((very unfinished))

will be done soon™

## Prerequisites

- Install your distro's `libfreenect-dev` (or equivalent) so the daemon's build script can mirror the Kinect headers and link against `libfreenect.so`.
